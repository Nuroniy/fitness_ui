# 🏋️‍♀️ Flutter UI – Progress & Fitness Tracker

A beautiful **Flutter UI template** designed for fitness tracking and activity progress. This project is **purely focused on UI** using Flutter — no backend (e.g., Supabase), no state management (`flutter_bloc`, `provider`, etc.), and no persistent storage.

It is ideal for use as a prototype or starting point for building a fitness, workout, or progress tracking mobile app.
